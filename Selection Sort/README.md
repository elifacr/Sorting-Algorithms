# **How does it work?**

## 1. Find the minimum element:
  *Start by finding the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the list.*

## 2. Swap with the first element:
  *Swap this smallest element with the first element of the unsorted part.*          
  *This places the smallest element in its correct sorted position.*

## 3. Repeat:
  *Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted part of the list, each time finding the next smallest element and swapping it into its correct position.*

## 4. Sorted:
  *The list is now sorted!*
